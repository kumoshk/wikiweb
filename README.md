# wikiweb
A wikiweb is used to make database projects with nodes related through contexts (it's not actually a wiki, athough I may adapt it for wiki use in future), and the features related to users logging in are not finished (don't use them).

See documentation.txt for information on wikiweb and how to use it.

To discuss this project, you may do so at `http://wikiweb.growspice.com`.
(Yes, you first have to register, and then become a member by posting in the Support forum that you agree to the rules. You can expect to wait at least a few minutes to 48 hours before your membership is approved.)

Dependencies:
* Python 3.x
* natsort (sudo pip3 install natsort)
* bcrypt (sudo pip3 install bcrypt)
* (optional) dill (sudo apt-get install python3-dill); to use dill instead of pickle, you'll need to edit the import section of wikiweb.py

wikiweb is not affiliated with any other projects known by the same name, nor was it inspired by them. I'm still working on a license, but I aim for it to be free-software or similar (I'll probably release it under multiple licenses, and you can take your pick from those). If you need a license before I decide on one, feel free to contact me about it at my website. This software does not come with any guarantees or warantees. Use it at your own risk.
